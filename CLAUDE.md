# FitMe (FitTracker2) — Project Rules

## Product Management Lifecycle

Every new feature MUST follow the PM workflow. Invoke with `/pm-workflow {feature-name}`.

**Phases:** Research → PRD → Tasks → UX/Integration → Implement → Test → Review → Merge → Docs

**Non-negotiable rules:**
1. No phase is skipped. Every phase requires explicit user approval.
2. No PRD without success metrics. Every feature defines: primary metric, baseline, target, kill criteria.
3. No merge without CI. Both feature branch AND main must be green.
4. Data drives decisions. Research, metrics, and kill criteria guide the lifecycle.
5. Post-launch metrics review is mandatory at the cadence defined in the PRD.
6. Phase transitions auto-sync to GitHub Issue labels (dashboard updates automatically).
7. Manual overrides allowed — user can move features forward (skip) or backward (rollback) at any time. Skipped phases are recorded in the audit trail.
8. Conflicts between state.json and GitHub Issues are resolved by asking the user.

## Branching Strategy

- **Large features** (>5 files changed OR new models/services) → `feature/{name}` branch
- **Small fixes** (<5 files, no new models) → direct task branch
- **Before merge:** parallel code review — diff feature vs main, identify risk areas
- **CI requirement:** both branches must pass before merge is approved
- **High-risk areas** that require extra review: DomainModels.swift, EncryptionService.swift, SupabaseSyncService.swift, CloudKitSyncService.swift, SignInService.swift, AuthManager.swift, AIOrchestrator.swift

## CI Pipeline

- Token check: `make tokens-check` (design system drift detection)
- Build: `xcodebuild build` (iOS Simulator, no code signing)
- Test: `xcodebuild test` (XCTest suite)
- All three must pass before any merge to main.

## Data-Driven Development

This app is data-driven at every level:
- **System-wide guardrails** (must not degrade for any feature):
  - Crash-free rate > 99.5%
  - Cold start < 2s
  - Sync success rate > 99%
  - CI pass rate > 95%
  - Cross-feature WAU (North Star) trending up or flat
- **Every feature** has a metrics section in its PRD with kill criteria
- **Post-launch** reviews happen at the cadence defined in the PRD

## Design System (Living Framework)

The design system is a **living, evolving framework** — not a static constraint. It should serve the product.

- ~125 semantic tokens in `FitTracker/Services/AppTheme.swift`
- 13 reusable components in `FitTracker/DesignSystem/`
- Token pipeline: `design-tokens/tokens.json` → Style Dictionary → `DesignTokens.swift`
- CI gate: `make tokens-check` prevents token drift
- Always use semantic tokens (AppColor, AppText, AppSpacing) — never raw literals

**Evolution rules:**
- New tokens/components are proposed on feature branches, never directly on main
- Phase 3 compliance gateway validates every UI feature against the design system
- If a feature needs to deviate, the user chooses: fix, evolve the system, or override with justification
- Approved changes merge to main with the feature and become part of the system
- All changes documented in `docs/design-system/feature-memory.md`
