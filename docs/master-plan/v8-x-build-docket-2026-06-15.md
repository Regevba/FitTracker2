# v8.x Build Docket — Sub-Plan

> **Status:** CURRENT · Extracted 2026-06-15 from [`infra-master-plan-2026-05-12.md`](infra-master-plan-2026-05-12.md) §3.1–§3.4 to give the v8.x feature docket its own home (mirrors how `test-coverage-master-plan`, `data-integrity-and-rollback`, and `analytics-master-plan` are separate sub-plans under the infra master plan).
>
> **Parent:** [`infra-master-plan-2026-05-12.md`](infra-master-plan-2026-05-12.md) — §3.5 (Calibration Protocol for new layers) and §3.6 (Forward Plan v7.9 → v8.2) **stay in the parent** (heavily cross-referenced); this sub-plan is authoritative for the **candidate docket** (what's queued, what shipped, what's iceboxed).
> **Predecessor ranking artifact:** [`v8-0-docket-ranking-2026-05-13.md`](v8-0-docket-ranking-2026-05-13.md) (frozen T29 prioritization, 2026-05-21).
> **Ready-now execution plan:** [`v8-0-ready-now-workplan-2026-06-15.md`](v8-0-ready-now-workplan-2026-06-15.md).
> **Canonical current state:** [`../FRAMEWORK-FACTS.md`](../FRAMEWORK-FACTS.md).

| ID | Item | Class | RICE-est | Gating |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| ~~F12~~ ✅ | `actionlint` warn-only CI on `.github/workflows/**` + `make actionlint` | ~~Write-time gate~~ → **CI linter** (reclassified: warn-only tooling like R18, not a state.json gate → no calibration walk) | **100.0 (highest)** | **SHIPPED** (feature `f12-actionlint-gate`; `.github/workflows/actionlint.yml` + Makefile target) |

**C. Paused / launch-gated:** F21 Sentry (pre-launch trigger; PR #418) · F-AUTH-LATENCY-SERVER-METRIC shipped FT2-side (fitme-story #208).

**D. Operator decision open:** W-MISTRAL-VERCEL-FREE-TIER-BURST (API-tier choice for multi-provider HADF experiments).

**Roll-up:** of the original 18 F-candidates, **17 shipped** (F2, F6, F9, F14, F15, F16, F17, GATE_COVERAGE_ZERO + F5, F10, F11, F12, F13 merged 2026-06-15 via PRs #719/#720/#721/#722 + F4 shipped 2026-06-16 via PR #740 + F1 + F3 shipped 2026-06-17 + **F18 shipped 2026-06-26 via PR #809**) + 2 resolved-by-exemption (F7, F8) → **all ready-now F-items shipped; remaining open** = F19/F20 (operator-gated, GA4 register A1) + F23 (Sentry-resume-gated, §C). **F22 shipped 2026-06-24 (#799); F-CONTRACT-consumer shipped 2026-06-22 (#790); F18 shipped 2026-06-26 (#809)** — reconciled 2026-06-26.

## 3. v8.0 Docket Decision Process (T29, 2026-05-21)

The 2026-05-21 prioritization pass at `framework-v7-8-branch-isolation` Phase 9 froze the candidate set via: (1) RICE × 7-day telemetry ranking; (2) top-3-per-theme rule (breadth over pure RICE); (3) companion case study; (4) hold-out sub-experiment; (5) Theme-G dependency precedence (F16 foundation). Full ranking: [`v8-0-docket-ranking-2026-05-13.md`](v8-0-docket-ranking-2026-05-13.md).
