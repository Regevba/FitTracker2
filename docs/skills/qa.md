# `/qa` — Quality Assurance

> **Role in the ecosystem:** The correctness layer. Owns test planning, execution, coverage reporting, regression checks, and security audits.

**Agent-facing prompt:** [`.claude/skills/qa/SKILL.md`](../../.claude/skills/qa/SKILL.md)

---

## What it does

Creates test plans from PRD acceptance criteria, executes test suites, measures coverage, runs regression checks, and performs security audits against the OWASP Mobile Top 10.

## Sub-commands

| Command | Purpose | Standalone Example | Hub Context |
|---|---|---|---|
| `/qa plan {feature}` | Generate test plan from PRD | "Create test plan for the onboarding feature" | Phase 5 (Test) |
| `/qa run` | Execute test suite | "Run all tests and report" | Phase 5 (Test) |
| `/qa coverage` | Coverage report by feature | "Which features have test gaps?" | Phase 5 (Test) |
| `/qa regression` | Post-merge regression | "Run regression on main after merge" | Phase 7 (Merge) |
| `/qa security` | OWASP security audit | "Run security audit on the auth module" | Phase 5 (Test) |

## Shared data

**Reads:** `feature-registry.json` (what to test), `metric-status.json` (quality guardrails).

**Writes:** `test-coverage.json` (per-feature coverage), `health-status.json` (quality gate status).

## System Guardrails (must NEVER degrade)

- Crash-free rate > 99.5%
- Cold start < 2s
- Sync success rate > 99%
- CI pass rate > 95%

`/qa` treats any regression against these as a P0 and blocks Phase 5 approval.

## PM workflow integration

| Phase | Dispatches |
|---|---|
| Phase 5 (Test) | `/qa plan` + `/qa run` + `/qa coverage` |
| Phase 5 analytics tests | `/analytics validate` pipes through the same test runner |
| Phase 7 (Merge) | `/qa regression` on main |

## Upstream / Downstream

- Writes coverage consumed by `/dev` and `/release`
- Receives bug dispatches from `/cx` when root cause = functionality
- Feeds quality-gate pass/fail to `/release` before submission

## Standalone usage examples

1. **Test planning:** `/qa plan onboarding` → generates test cases from PRD acceptance criteria with effort estimates
2. **Quick test run:** `/qa run` → executes `make tokens-check` + `xcodebuild build` + `xcodebuild test`
3. **Security check:** `/qa security` → checks encryption (AES-256-GCM), Keychain ACL, JWT handling, PII exposure
