# Framework v7.10 — cold-start entrypoint

> One-page summary of v7.10 for any agent or developer arriving cold.
> If you only read one document about v7.10, read this. Then drill into the
> "Canonical sources" section.

**Shipped:** 2026-06-10.
**Predecessor:** [v7.9.1 Build Window](framework-v7-9.md) (shipped 2026-06-04) → [v7.9 Promotion](framework-v7-9.md) (2026-05-21).
**Current-state reference (live counts):** [`docs/FRAMEWORK-FACTS.md`](../../docs/FRAMEWORK-FACTS.md).

## Why v7.10 exists

v7.10 hardens the **observability of the gates themselves** — the meta-layer that watches whether each gate is actually running. No new product-facing gates; the change makes the silent-pass detector see checks it previously couldn't. It also closes two reader/index field-rename silent-passes of the `created`/`created_at` class (observed-patterns #24) at the measurement layer.

## What v7.10 ships

| Item | What | File | Mode |
|---|---|---|---|
| **`GATE_COVERAGE_ZERO` extension** | Reads the F17 `gate-last-fired.json` index; flags a gate gone silent vs the active corpus + a **0-candidate mis-wire detector** (a gate registered but `candidates==checked==skipped==0` runs but never reaches a candidate — distinct from a *healthy* zero-firing gate) | [`scripts/integrity-check.py`](../../scripts/integrity-check.py) (PR #689) | Advisory |
| **Cycle-time coverage emission** | `BROKEN_PR_CITATION` + `CASE_STUDY_MISSING_TIER_TAGS` + `PATTERN_SKILL_UNMAPPED` now emit `mode="cycle"` Mechanism A coverage (previously blind to the F17 index) | [`scripts/integrity-check.py`](../../scripts/integrity-check.py) (PR #689) | — |
| **Field-rename closure (#24)** | `measurement-adoption-report.py` read only legacy `complexity.cu_version` not canonical `cu_v2` (halved adoption; PR #687); `refresh-gate-last-fired.py` read only `timestamp`, dropping `w9.auto_isolate` rows keyed `ts` (PR #688) | reader scripts | — |

## Current canonical counts (reconciled 2026-06-15)

**v7.10 · 106 features · 26 instrumented gates (17 write-time + 7 cycle-time + 2 W9 hooks), 19 firing · 0 integrity findings, 0 real regressions.** Full breakdown + gate list: [`docs/FRAMEWORK-FACTS.md`](../../docs/FRAMEWORK-FACTS.md).

> Earlier docs report different gate totals (25 / 27 / 30 / 33 / 34 / 37) — those are accurate records of earlier eras OR count a different denominator (mechanisms+CI+hooks ≈ 37 vs gate codes ≈ 26). Always check the date.
